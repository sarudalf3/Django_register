# Register and log in

In this exercise I create an application to enter or register on my application, validate some fields (fname, lname, birthday date and password), and enter in the home application.

This is the first time I use request.session and databases, merging with bootstrap, css and HTMl to create templates.

This is my first humble application, It was so difficult to do it.

**This is an optional exercise of full-Stack Python Bootcamp offered by coding dojo**
